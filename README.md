    Weather Forecasting App
The Weather Forecasting App is a Python-based application that provides users with up-to-date weather information for any city worldwide.
Leveraging the OpenWeatherMap API, this app fetches real-time weather data including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description, and presents it in an easy-to-read format.

    Features
City-based Weather Forecast: Users can input the name of any city and receive accurate weather forecasts for that location.

Detailed Weather Information: The app retrieves and displays comprehensive weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description,
allowing users to plan their activities accordingly.

Simple Command-Line Interface: The app offers a straightforward command-line interface, making it easy for users to access weather information without any complexity.

    Why Weather Forecasting App?
